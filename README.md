## 351Noir AmberELEC Theme

** Thanks MonsieurDaz for creating this theme at first place**. Find the [original theme](https://github.com/MonsieurDaz/es-theme-351noir) available on their Github [MonsieurDaz](https://github.com/MonsieurDaz)

Editors: Szalik ( me ) and [kulvind3r](https://github.com/kulvind3r)

Here we have added missing system backgrounds and made minor improvement and fixes to their base idea as they don't have time and give us the green light for doing it :)

This is a modern **horizontal** theme based on [Epic Noir](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir), that matches the 351ELEC black/white/red aesthetic and the RG351P handheld's resolution and aspect ratio.

### Theme Notes

This theme supports video. You can also use a scraped image in conjunction with the video. If you scrape both, when a game is selected, it will show the screenshot for a couple of seconds before fading and playing the video.

Game screenshots are not included within the theme. You can scrape your own - you should use game boxart/screenshots and/or videos.
